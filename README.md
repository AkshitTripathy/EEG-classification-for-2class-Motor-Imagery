# EEG-classification-for-2class-Motor-Imagery


In this Project I have implemented CSP(Common Spatial Filtering) feature extaction technique. The success of Machine Learning Algorithms is dependent on the features provided to them. These techniques have been implemented to observe the differences in classification accuracy as one changes the features. One of the problems faced while decoding EEG signals is that one cannot train classifiers on one subject and test on another.
